<p>I was born and brought up in India I’m belongs to a hardworking farmer family and they always encourage me to study, learn and thought me good values. Personally I inherited a core value ‘Never Give Up’ from my parents that inspires me to reach my goals till now and I hope that will help me for my future goals as well 
    In my life, my school teachers and college professors played a key role as they thought me honest, punctual, politeness and they always encourage me to do more creative things. I have an younger brother always used to support me .In my 7 years of my marriage life, I’m glad that I got a lovely husband and 2 kids they going to school now. 
    Below is the list of my Strengths and weaknesses that was collected from my colleagues, friends and family members

    <h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.
    </h2>
<p>One of the emotional situation in my life was that I had to leave my JOB due to tough pregnancy for my 2nd kid I was working as a database administrator for a big Multinational company prior to the delivery 
    I believe I took the right decision on choosing option for being full time baby care rather seeking nanny help to look after my child but I had to sacrifice my dream job. I gave priority to t to my lovely baby so no regret in that but now finding a job in current IT market I need to up skill myself.
    Again I had options of choosing college study, remote study and join dev academy. I have chosen dev academy as it gives me a new experience of learning as I did studies in college for my academics already and also finished the remote study for my certifications. I struggle a bit during my sprints to reach my goals but that should be okay since I develop my problem solving skills myself

    <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity?
    </h2>
    <p>I used to have my family members and college friends all time with me which helps me to build up my team working skills. My college degree scoring (above 80%) and the reviews from my professors shows that I m a hardworking person to try to accomplish the task without fail. My recent certification shows that I am a dedicated person to learn and achieve the technical goals 
    </p>
    <h2>Describe your strengths and limitations through explaining a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make
    ?</h2>
    <p>I believe ‘never give up’ policy and ‘dedication’ both helping me to get back to the technical ladder after a 4 year career gap. One point of time I was thinking that I ‘m totally lost and impossible to get onboard again however my self-motivation and positive thinking played a crucial role to put me into right direction 
    </p>
<h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development?
</h2>
<p>During my life as a mother I learnt patience, flexible, teaching skills and also great management skills. I believe these skills helps me to put myself as a good team player in my career development
