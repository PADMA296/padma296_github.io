        <h1>MY Learning Plan</h1>
        <h2>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
<p>I would like to be a solution architect in IT in next couple of years and to achieve that I believe I should have strong development skills as well as admin skills so since I got admin skills my previous IT experience, now I should pick up developer skills through my dev academy journey 
</p>
<h2>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning?</h2>
<p> I believe I’m a self-motivated person, quick learner, honest and reliable person 
    I also believe I’m nervous when I get any road blocks and unable to achieve my targets in time so seeking help is the solution but I’m still working on improving posting in channels and talking to people. Hope I will be fine in the future but I’m still not confident
    </p>
    <h2>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
<p>At this stage I need both technical and non-technical. I consider I need Communication skills, inter personal skills, writing better emails to bring up my confidence skills to next level</p>
<h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programmed. This should include?</h2>
<p>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives?
    </p>
<p>I don’t have any other commitments and fully focused to my dev academy learnings. I set my own targets which are little ahead of real targets so that I will be in better position during submission of my sprints and that also put me in out of nervous mode. I use channels, google and facilitator’s to fix my road blocks. 
    I ‘m still finding a better way to cope up with the nervous times where I get all my tasks/ things are filing up but usually I follow a method of organizing/planning  things a head of the schedule 
    A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
    
    </p>
    <h2>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you?
    </h2>
    <p> If I'm in that situation take along breath. Divided my work into little chunks I can go through that one after another if I'm stuck with one thing more than 30 to 60 min I'll trying find the solution workaround in the google and  seek help from the foundation channel others 
    </p>
    <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way?
    </h2>
    <p>I usually trying to seek help from  in foundation channels, google and facilitators to get help on my work 
    </p>
    <h2>
        A description of what you expect from the facilitation team?
    </h2>
    <p>I can’t comment as my facilitator mentioned that I should approach him/her as a last resourceas per my understanding he/she should be a Scrum Master in IT company
    </p>
    <h2>
        Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in?

    </h2>
    <p>I always preplan/organize things. If there is a blackout, I can seek help from other family member if they can help me out else I’ll postpone my work.
        I’ll club my personal calendar with my work calendar for any hospital or any critical appointments.
        If there is any conflict with the appointments, I’ll prioritize and update the meeting organizer ahead of time to cancel with an explanatory note
