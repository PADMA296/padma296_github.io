<H2>Difference between HTML, CSS &JAVA Script?</H2>
<p> HTML, CSS and JAVA all are web design languages. Using HTML and CSS we can create static webpages 
    only but using JavaScript we can develop attractive dynamic webpages.</p>
<p> Using HTML we create the structure of a website and let CSS allow us to make the website looks nice
    Last but not least JavaScript allow us to create keyboard shortcuts for our websites and also we can play animation video, screen savers etc.
    </p>
    <p>If we want to explain above 3 in plain English I would consider human body as an example---  Html makes the structure of our body like setting up bones and skeleton 
        CSS defines the looks of the body like skin color, hair style etc. 
        Java Script covers the makeup and dressing to make our website more beautiful and attractive.</p>

        <div> <h2>Control Flow and Loops in everyday life:</h2>
        <p>Control Flow is nothing but a sequence of steps execution in a particular order to fulfill the requirement 
            We can take dough preparation (for Pizza) as an example and below are the steps resembles the control flow 
            
            </p>
            <p>
                1. Take the flour and weigh off 300 grams using the weighing scale.<br>
                2. Take the flour and add it to the bowl.<br>
                3. Add the yeast, salt, and water to it.<br>
                4. Start to knead the mixture.<br>
                5. During this process add olive oil to the dough, until it gets smooth and a little moist.<br>
                6. Knead it for about 5 minutes. This way the ingredients get well mixed and it will be smoother.
                7. Once finished put it back in the bowl and cover it with a cloth.<br> 
                Place the covered dough on a warm spot (heater for example) and leave it there for about 45 minutes. 
            </p>
            <p>Following the above sequence of instructions we can prepare dough this is
                 nothing but following a control flow of instructions </p>
<h3>LOOPS:-</h3>
<p>Loop means particular function or statements executing continuously in java we can use 'for, while and do while' loops also
     there are 2 types of loops as conditional and unconditional </p>
     <p>
        Below car wash example helps us to understand what exactly the LOOP means. The following sequence of steps are performed to complete a single car wash 
             </p>
<p>
    1. Park the car<br>
    2. Vacuum the interior<br>
    3. Wax the car<br>
    4. Wash the car<br>
    5. Dry the exterior<br>
</p>
<p>
    Now let's assume a robot has to wash five cars and he will be repeating the sequence of above steps for each car wash so this called conditional loop 
</p>
<p>
     below is the explanation<br>
     for (C=1;C<=5;C+1);<br>
     {
    . Park the car<br>
    . Vacuum the interior<br>
    . Wax the car<br>
    . Wash the car<br>
    . Dry the exterior <br> 
     }<br>
1.	we ask the robot to start with one car (c=1)<br>
2.	Continue to do all tasks till he/she washes 5cars(c<=5)<br>
3.	Washes one car at atime(c+1)<br>
4.	Stops after 5 cars.<br>

</p>
<p>
    If we ask the robot to wash as many cars he/she needs to repeat the steps for 
    unlimited number of times this is called unconditional loop the robot will keep repeating the steps for every car and will not stop until we program to stop with a break statement. 
    In every programming language it is referred as while and do while loops

<h2> how to interact with DOM &DEVTOOLS:</h2>
<p>
    The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents The Document Object 
    Model is a family tree like representation of the HTML elements on a page. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects HTML elements can be nested inside one another 
    which the DOM sees as a child of that element. 
    the below example is The DOM sees the H1 as a child of body. 
</p>
<<p><img src="../pics/dom.jpg"></p></div><br>
<p>Dev tools in chrome helps us to see the elements on a page and of course we have a range of web developer tools that are built directly into the browser.
 This is great for testing code changes on the fly rather than having to open
  your code in a text editor. It also allows for some "behind the scenes" 
  of how the website is performing. DevTools works with the DOM by enabling us
  to manipulate the DOM on the fly and see what different changes could look like.</p>

    <h2>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>
<p>An array is a special type of variable, which can store multiple values It consists of an ordered list containing zero or more data types and Arrays can contain any data type including numbers, strings, and objects. 
    The following figure illustrates how an array stores values. </p>
    <p><img src="../pics/Array.JPG"></p><br>
    <p>
        An object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method) and 
        it’s a collection of related data or functionality. For example: car, pen, bike, chair, glass, keyboard, monitor etc. JavaScript is an object-based language and everything act as an object in JavaScript. 
        Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, 
        except for the attachment to objects. 
        The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object.

<h2>
    what functions are and why they are useful:
</h2>
<p>
    Function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. 
    They are useful as the function allows us to define and structure a block of code, give it a name, and helps us make the code reusable
Example would be a wearing a ‘cloth mask’ could be reusable after wash rather than using a ‘one time use’ mask 
</p>
<p>
    <p><img src="../pics/function.JPG"></p>
    In JavaScript, a function allows you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want. JavaScript function can be defined using function keyword. A function can have one or more parameters, which will be supplied by the calling code and can be used inside a function. JavaScript is a dynamic type scripting language,
     so a function parameter can have value of any data type.
