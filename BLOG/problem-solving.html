    <h2> WHAT IS PROBLEM SOLVING? </h2>
    <p>
        Solving problems means making choices. Typically, effective problem-solving skills result in “happier, more confident, and more independent” individuals. 
        When children tackle problems on their own, or in a group, they become resilient.They learn to look at challenges from a fresh perspective.

    <h2>problem solving techniques and process:</h2>
    <P>
        problem solving doesn’t mean going away and coming up with an answer immediately. In fact, this isn’t good problem solving at all,
        because you’ll be running with the first solution that comes into your mind, which often isn’t the best.
    </P>
    <P>
        problem solving more as a process with several steps
        involved that will help you reach the best outcome. Those steps are:
    </P>
    <P>
           <B> Define the problem</B><BR>
            <p>
                Problem solver will take the thoughts of everyone involved into account, but different people might 
                have different ideas on what the root cause of the issue really is. It’s up to you to actively listen 
                to everyone without bringing any of your own preconceived notions to the conversation. Learning to differentiate facts from opinion is an essential part of this process.
            </p>
          </B> List all the possible solutions</B><br>
          <p>
                Once you’ve identified what the real issue is, it’s time to think of solutions. Brainstorming as many solutions as
             possible will help you arrive at the best answer because you’ll be considering all potential options and scenarios.
          </p>
            <b>Evaluate the options </b><br>
            <p>
                Each option will have pros and cons, and it’s important you list all of these, as well as how each solution could impact key stakeholders. Once you’ve narrowed down your options 
                to three or four, it’s often a good idea to go to other employees for feedback just in case you’ve missed something. 
            </p>
            <b>Select the best solution</b><br>
            <p>
                Only now should you choose which solution you’re going to go with. What you decide should be 
                whatever solves the problem most effectively while also taking the interests of everyone involved into account. 
            </p>
            <b>Create an implementation plan</b><br>
            <p>
                Create an implementation plan on how you will put your solution into practice. One problem solving technique that many use here is 
                to introduce a testing and feedback phase just to make sure the option you’ve selected really is the most viable. 
            </p>
            <b>Communicate your solution</b><br>
            <p>
                There’s one last step to consider as part of the problem solving methodology, and that’s communicating your solution
                
            </p>
