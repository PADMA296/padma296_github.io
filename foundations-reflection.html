    <h1>MY FOUNDATIONS JOURNEY</h1>
    <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
    <p>
        Before dev academy I was a nervous and shy person to reach out anyone and hesitation on my communication skills. I was thinking wrong as it may give wrong impression going to other for help however after finishing couple sprints,
        I was socialising myself into foundation channel and seeking help on my errors also helping other ppl to solve their piece of codes.
    </p>
    <p>
        By writing reflections on each sprint, I improved my confidence to next level. I realized the importance of Conscious Listening and also, I learnt how to emotionally connect with other people.
        I learnt organizing and preplanning the technical challenges that also helped me to manage my time efficiently
    </p>
    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
    <p>
        My values of dedication, honesty and helping others were important for sticking at problems 
        I have to Spend at least as much time on writing code and applying what you have learned as you do on studying
        Self-awareness is a true and clear inner sense of awareness of your true skills. For example Identifying your strengths and shortcomings
        Empathy helps to develop the team building skills It helps the developer to take responsibility for their own work.
    </p>
    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
    <p>
        I came to know about myself very well realized about my capabilities strengths and weaknesses 
        also how to unleash the potential of my strengths
        I personal enjoyed is creating blog posts on topics.
    </p>
    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
    <p>
     Core part also time consuming  like  tech part I was thinking core part bit easier than tech part but it's not
     I personally believe hardest part Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset.
    </p>
    <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development boot camp course?</h2>
    <p>
        From my personal experience, I attended a couple of interviews in new Zealand in each and every interview 
        panel more focused on the behavioral skills and the source of behavioral skill comes from the core competencies so we must do these ones.
    </p>
    <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
    <p>
       NO,I believe it's critical and it's not a waste of time
       As I mentioned in previous answer core competencies are highly important.
